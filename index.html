      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          Hi there! My name is Brian Sanchez, an experienced behavior and child/adultcare specialist currently working as a Qualified Mental Health Professional for Individual's diagnosed with Intellectual/Developmental Disability, including 10+ years of experience towards building and staff management. 
        </p>
        <p>
           Proficient in Spanish and English; currently learning but not limited too: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
           I stepped into the world of coding through UT Austin Continuing Education Coding Bootcamp to learn the language of code and its different properties. 
           With this knowledge gained, it will provide the right tools to step into an exciting and fast paced career I strive for. 
           I am also a father of three boys currently living in Killeen, Texas. Raised in Los Angeles, California and moved to Texas when I was 13 years old. 
           A fun fact about me is my entire family is originally from Managua, Nicaragua! Some hobbies of mine, I truly enjoy playing video games and cooking, both give me an outlet for creative expression.
            
        </p>
